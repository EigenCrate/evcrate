# evc-cmd-skill-x-add

Command Path: $evc-cmd-skill-x-add

Description: Add new reference files or scripts to a skill

Codex note: when this recipe says to run another `$evc-cmd-…` command, invoke the matching `evc-cmd-*` skill for that path.

For high-impact architecture, security, debugging, or review decisions, consider explicit `$advisor-strategy` use for current-session guidance; this pointer does not activate it.

## Subagent Completion Contract

Delegation is blocking by default. The parent agent must wait for each delegated agent's terminal response before starting dependent work, touching shared files, marking a step complete, or replying with a final result.

- Parallel prompt format: **spawn N agents; wait for all N to finish; collect one terminal result from each; then summarize**.
- Wait protocol: use the native agent wait/poll operation for the same agent set. **"No agents completed yet" is a non-terminal poll result; wait again.** Do not treat this as a timeout, sleep instead of polling, restart, interrupt, or advance the workflow.
- A polling interval or retry count is not a delegation deadline. Do not invent a wall-clock limit. Continue polling until a terminal result, explicit user stop, or an actual parent-runtime termination.
- Treat an interrupted, timed-out, missing, or partial result as a failed gate. Do not continue from partial output or silently restart it.
- Sequential prompt format: **run one agent; wait for its terminal response before continuing**.
- Every delegated prompt must define scope, file ownership, expected report, and validation signal.
- A spawn acknowledgement or file change does not mean completion; completion requires the terminal response and requested validation.
Think harder.
Use `skill-creator` and `claude-code` skills.
Use `docs-seeker` skills to search for documentation if needed.

## Arguments
$1: skill name (required, default: "")
$2: reference or script prompt (required, default: "")
If $1 or $2 is not provided, ask the user to provide it.

## Your mission
Add new reference files or scripts to a skill at `.agents/skills/$1` directory.

## Requirements
<reference-or-script-prompt>
$2
</reference-or-script-prompt>

## Rules of Skill Creation:
Base on the requirements:
- Always keep in mind that `SKILL.md` and reference files should be token consumption efficient, so that **progressive disclosure** can be leveraged at best.
- `SKILL.md` is always short and concise, straight to the point, treat it as a quick reference guide.
- If you're given nothing, use `request_user_input` tool for clarifications and `evc-researcher` subagent to research about the topic.
- If you're given an URL, it's documentation page, use `Explore` subagent to explore every internal link and report back to main agent, don't skip any link.
- If you receive a lot of URLs, use multiple `Explore` subagents to explore them in parallel, then report back to main agent.
- If you receive a lot of files, use multiple `Explore` subagents to explore them in parallel, then report back to main agent.
- If you're given a Github URL, use [`repomix`](https://repomix.com/guide/usage) command to summarize ([install it](https://repomix.com/guide/installation) if needed) and spawn multiple `Explore` subagents to explore it in parallel, then report back to main agent.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Skills are not documentation, they are practical instructions for Claude Code to use the tools, packages, plugins or APIs to achieve the tasks.
- Each skill teaches Claude how to perform a specific development task, not what a tool does.
- Claude Code can activate multiple skills automatically to achieve the user's request.
