Command Path: /fix:hard

Description: ⚡⚡⚡ Use subagents to plan and fix hard issues

Codex note: when this recipe says to run another `/...` command, invoke the matching `cmd_*` skill for that path.

For high-impact architecture, security, debugging, or review decisions, consider explicit `$advisor-strategy` use for current-session guidance; this pointer does not activate it.

## Subagent Completion Contract

Delegation is blocking by default. The parent agent must wait for each delegated agent's terminal response before starting dependent work, touching shared files, marking a step complete, or replying with a final result.

- Parallel prompt format: **spawn N agents; wait for all N to finish; collect one terminal result from each; then summarize**.
- Wait protocol: use the native agent wait/poll operation for the same agent set. **"No agents completed yet" is a non-terminal poll result; wait again.** Do not treat it as a timeout, sleep instead of polling, restart, interrupt, or advance the workflow.
- A polling interval or retry count is not a delegation deadline. Do not invent a wall-clock limit (including 180 seconds) for a blocking gate. Continue polling until a terminal result, explicit user stop, or an actual parent-runtime termination.
- Treat an interrupted, timed-out, missing, or partial result as a failed gate. Do not continue from partial work or silently skip/restart the agent.
- Sequential prompt format: **run one agent; wait for its terminal result; verify the report/artifacts; then run the next agent**.
- Every delegated prompt must define scope, file ownership, expected report/artifact, and validation signal.
- A spawn acknowledgement, progress event, or file change does not mean the agent completed. Completion requires the terminal response and requested validation.
- If the parent runtime ends before completion, preserve the agent identity and report the gate as incomplete; never fabricate a result or launch a replacement.

## Advice Mode

A final standalone `--advice` activates explicit review mentoring in `/code`.
Before analysis, read `.codex/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md` and derive
`WORK_ARGUMENTS` plus explicit/default advice mode. Use `WORK_ARGUMENTS` as the
issue input and apply the shared default stuck-escalation contract.

## Workflow:

If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `ai-multimodal` skill to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure developers can predict the root causes easily based on the description.

### Fullfill the request
**Question Everything**: Use `request_user_input` tool to ask probing questions to fully understand the user's request, constraints, and true objectives. Don't assume - clarify until you're 100% certain.

* If you have any questions, use `request_user_input` tool to ask the user to clarify them.
* Ask 1 question at a time, wait for the user to answer before moving to the next question.
* If you don't have any questions, start the next step.

### Fix the issue

Use `sequential-thinking` skill to break complex problems into sequential thought steps.
Use `problem-solving` skills to tackle the issues.
Analyze the skills catalog and activate other skills that are needed for the task during the process.

1. Use `debugger` subagent to find the root cause of the issues and report back to main agent.
2. Use `researcher` subagent to research quickly about the root causes on the internet (if needed) and report back to main agent.
3. Use `planner` subagent to create an implementation plan based on the reports, then report back to main agent.
4. Then Use the matching `cmd_*` skill to run `/code` to implement the plan step by step. This fallback
   handoff uses `WORK_ARGUMENTS`; append exactly one trailing `--advice` in explicit
   mode and otherwise pass no `--advice` token.
5. Final Report:
  * Report back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, guide user to get started and suggest the next steps.
  * Ask the user if they want to commit and push to git repository, if yes, use `git-manager` subagent to commit and push to git repository.
  - **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
  - **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

**REMEMBER**:
- You can always generate images with `ai-multimodal` skills on the fly for visual assets.
- You always read and analyze the generated assets with `ai-multimodal` skills to verify they meet requirements.
- For image editing (removing background, adjusting, cropping), use `ImageMagick` skill or similar tools as needed.
