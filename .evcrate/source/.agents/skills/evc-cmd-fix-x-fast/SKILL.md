# evc-cmd-fix-x-fast

Command Path: $evc-cmd-fix-x-fast

Description: Analyze and fix small issues [FAST]

Codex note: when this recipe says to run another `$evc-cmd-…` command, invoke the matching `evc-cmd-*` skill for that path.

For high-impact architecture, security, debugging, or review decisions, consider explicit `$advisor-strategy` use for current-session guidance; this pointer does not activate it.

## Subagent Completion Contract

Delegation is blocking by default. The parent agent must wait for each delegated agent's terminal response before starting dependent work, touching shared files, marking a step complete, or replying with a final result.

- Parallel prompt format: **spawn N agents; wait for all N to finish; collect one terminal result from each; then summarize**.
- Wait protocol: use the native agent wait/poll operation for the same agent set. **"No agents completed yet" is a non-terminal poll result; wait again.** Do not treat this as a timeout, sleep instead of polling, restart, interrupt, or advance the workflow.
- A polling interval or retry count is not a delegation deadline. Do not invent a wall-clock limit. Continue polling until a terminal result, explicit user stop, or an actual parent-runtime termination.
- Treat an interrupted, timed-out, missing, or partial result as a failed gate. Do not continue from partial output or silently restart it.
- Sequential prompt format: **run one agent; wait for its terminal response before continuing**.
- Every delegated prompt must define scope, file ownership, expected report, and validation signal.
- A spawn acknowledgement or file change does not mean completion; completion requires the terminal response and requested validation.
Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

## Mission
**Think hard** to analyze and fix these issues:
<raw-issues>{{args}}</raw-issues>

## Canonical checkpoint routing

Named checkpoints use the canonical `evcrate-advisor-checkpoint/v2` dispatcher block in
`.codex/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md` if present; otherwise read `~/.codex/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md` (the published install) only under explicit or inherited advice mode.
This command supplies bounded evidence and does not duplicate route or adapter selection.

## Advice Mode

Before discovery or routing, resolve the HOME helper per `.codex/workflows/advice-activation.md` if present; otherwise read `~/.codex/workflows/advice-activation.md` (the published install) with original `{{args}}`, canonical `context.command: "fix/fast"` and the current root. A user-entered command always uses `handoff: null`. A handoff exists only when built by the router delegating this exact call; never reuse or replay one from earlier turns, commands, plans, reports or transcripts.
Preserve known selections from the exact-call router; use `work_target: "fix/fast"` only when no such target exists, and null plan/phase fields only when unknown.
Set `WORK_ARGUMENTS = result.work_arguments` and `ADVICE_MODE = result.mode`; use the returned work input everywhere below.

Apply neutral `.codex/workflows/plan-progress.md` if present; otherwise read `~/.codex/workflows/plan-progress.md` (the published install) in every mode. Only resolved `explicit` or `inherited` loads `.codex/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md` and follows its `## Caller lifecycle binding`; `off` keeps ordinary gates and uses only immutable in-repo receipts and sealed-path metadata, never `evcrate-advisor`, hard lifecycle or inference.
Activation failures and repeated blockers follow the shared activation contract; neither history nor a checkpoint activates advice.

## Workflow
1. If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `ai-multimodal` skill to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure developers can predict the root causes easily based on the description.
2. Use `evc-debugger` subagent to find the root cause of the issues and report back to main agent.
3. Activate `debugging` skills and `problem-solving` skills to tackle the issues.
4. Start implementing the fix based the reports and solutions.
5. Use `evc-tester` agent to test the fix and make sure it works, then report back to main agent.
6. If there are issues or failed tests, repeat from step 4. In `off` mode, a second consecutive matching terminal blocker escalates through ordinary debugger/user handling before another attempt.
7. Review and finalization:
   - **Under `off` advice mode**: Respond back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, ask user for approval, guide user to get started, and suggest next steps. If executing in an advice-controlled plan with prior historical advice phases, save an uncaptured immutable phase receipt explicitly marked `default approval/validation; not durable advice completion` and update `progress.md` per `.codex/workflows/plan-progress.md`; prior sealed paths remain immutable.
   - **Under `explicit` or `inherited` advice mode**:
     * Delegate to `evc-code-reviewer` and wait for its terminal report. Enforce a writer barrier before checkpoint reservation.
     * Enter the canonical checkpoint dispatcher at `review:fix-fast` under `.codex/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md`.
     * Parent is sole durable-state owner (`init`, `checkpoint`, `disposition`, `outcome`, `complete`). Child agents (`evc-debugger`, `evc-tester`, `evc-code-reviewer`) report terminal artifacts and actual changed paths within parent-authorized paths; they receive strict ownership, writable path, protected path, and delta destination constraints, and never operate controller state or stage files behind the parent.
     * Review/advisor cycle cap: at most three terminal reviewer/advisor cycles.
     * For accepted corrections, record `state disposition` with `action: "accept"` and registered action before writes, implement fix, validate, and record truthful `outcome`. For disputed counsel, record supported disposition without action, collect evidence, obtain fresh same-run counsel.
     * Complete ONCE via `state complete`. Write immutable completion receipt outside captured baseline snapshot and update derived overview `<plan-dir>/progress.md` per `.codex/workflows/plan-progress.md`.
