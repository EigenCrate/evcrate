description: "Low-risk fast cook: scout, plan fast, implement with quality gates"
---

Think harder to plan & start working on these tasks follow the Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team and Development Rules:
<raw-tasks>$ARGUMENTS</raw-tasks>

## Canonical checkpoint routing

Named checkpoints use the `evcrate-advisor-checkpoint/v1` dispatcher block in
`.omp/evcrate/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md` if present; otherwise read `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md`; this command supplies bounded evidence
and does not duplicate route or adapter selection.

## Advice Mode

A final standalone `--advice` activates explicit review mentoring in `/cmd-code`.
Before scouting, read `.omp/evcrate/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md` if present; otherwise read `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md` and derive
`WORK_ARGUMENTS` plus explicit/default advice mode. Use `WORK_ARGUMENTS` as the
task input and apply the shared default stuck-escalation contract.
For every fallback handoff, pass `WORK_ARGUMENTS`; append exactly one trailing
`--advice` in explicit mode and otherwise pass no `--advice` token.

## Role Responsibilities
- You are an elite software engineering expert who specializes in system architecture design and technical decision-making. 
- You operate by the holy trinity of software engineering: **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It), **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself). Every solution you propose must honor these principles.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

---

**IMPORTANT**: Analyze the list of skills  at `.omp/skills/*` and intelligently activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.**

## Positioning

Use this only for tiny, familiar, low-risk tasks or demos. Do not use it for public APIs, auth, permissions, payments, data migrations, security-sensitive code, or broad refactors.

## Workflow

- **Scout**: Use `scout` subagent to find related resources, documents, tests, public contracts, and code snippets in the current codebase.
- **Fast Preflight**: State concise output, acceptance criteria, scope boundary, risk areas, and testing strategy. If any item is unclear or high risk, stop and route to base `/cmd-cook` with `WORK_ARGUMENTS` and the same explicit advice mode.
- **Plan**: Trigger slash command `/cmd-plan__fast <detailed-instruction-prompt>` to create an implementation plan based on scout findings and fast preflight.
- **Implementation**: Trigger slash command `/cmd-code <plan-path-name>` to implement the plan with compile/typecheck, tests, and code review gates. In explicit advice mode append exactly one trailing `--advice`; otherwise append none.
- **Fallback handoff**: If `/cmd-code` finds broad scope, failing tests, critical review issues, or unclear acceptance criteria, continue with base `/cmd-cook` or `/cmd-fix__hard` using `WORK_ARGUMENTS`; append exactly one trailing `--advice` in explicit mode and otherwise pass no `--advice` token.

**OMP skill loading (runtime):** `omp --no-skills` disables skill discovery and loading. When that flag is active, do not claim automatic skill activation: read each required migrated `SKILL.md` directly with the read tool from `./.omp/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, falling back to `~/.omp/agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. If the native file is absent, consult `./.omp/evcrate/skill-map.json` or `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skill-map.json`, then read the archived package under `./.omp/evcrate/skills/` (or the published `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skills/` path), then follow the instructions. Without `--no-skills`, use OMP's normal skill discovery.
