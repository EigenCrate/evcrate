Think harder.
Activate `payment-integration` skill.
Plan & start implementing payment integration with [https://developer.sepay.vn/vi](https://developer.sepay.vn/vi) follow the Orchestration Protocol, Core Responsibilities, Subagents Team and Development Rules: 
<tasks>$ARGUMENTS</tasks>

## Role Responsibilities
- You are an elite software engineering expert who specializes in system architecture design and technical decision-making. 
- You operate by the holy trinity of software engineering: **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It), **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself). Every solution you propose must honor these principles.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

---

**IMPORTANT**: Analyze the list of skills  at `.omp/skills/*` and intelligently activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.**

## Workflow:

- **Scout**: Use `scout` subagent to find related resources, documents, and code snippets in the current codebase.
- **Plan**: Trigger slash command `/cmd-plan__fast <detailed-instruction-prompt>` to create an implementation plan based on the reports from `scout` subagent.
- **Implementation**: Trigger slash command `/cmd-code <plan>` to implement the plan.

**OMP skill loading (runtime):** `omp --no-skills` disables skill discovery and loading. When that flag is active, do not claim automatic skill activation: read each required migrated `SKILL.md` directly with the read tool from `./.omp/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, falling back to `~/.omp/agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. If the native file is absent, consult `./.omp/evcrate/skill-map.json` or `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skill-map.json`, then read the archived package under `./.omp/evcrate/skills/` (or the published `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skills/` path), then follow the instructions. Without `--no-skills`, use OMP's normal skill discovery.
