## Pre-Creation Check (Active vs Suggested Plan Detection)

Check the `## Plan Context` section in the injected context:
- If "Plan:" shows a path → Active plan exists. Ask user: "Active plan found: {path}. Continue with this? [Y/n]"
- If "Suggested:" shows a path → Branch-matched plan hint only. Ask user if they want to activate it or create new.
- If "Plan: none" → Proceed to create new plan using naming pattern from `## Naming` section.

## Workflow
- Analyze the given task and use `ask the user` tool to ask for more details if needed.
- Decide to use `/cmd-plan__fast` or `/cmd-plan__hard` OMP commands based on the complexity.
- Execute OMP command: `/cmd-plan__fast <detailed-instructions-prompt>` or `/cmd-plan__hard <detailed-instructions-prompt>`
- Activate `planning` skill.
- Note: `detailed-instructions-prompt` is **an enhanced prompt** that describes the task in detail based on the provided task description.

## Important Notes
**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
**IMPORTANT**: **Do not** start implementing.

**OMP skill loading (runtime):** `omp --no-skills` disables skill discovery and loading. When that flag is active, do not claim automatic skill activation: read each required migrated `SKILL.md` directly with the read tool from `./.omp/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, falling back to `~/.omp/agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. If the native file is absent, consult `./.omp/evcrate/skill-map.json` or `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skill-map.json`, then read the archived package under `./.omp/evcrate/skills/` (or the published `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skills/` path), then follow the instructions. Without `--no-skills`, use OMP's normal skill discovery.
