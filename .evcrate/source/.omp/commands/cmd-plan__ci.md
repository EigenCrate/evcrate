description: Analyze Github Actions logs and provide a plan to fix the issues
argument-hint: [github-actions-url]

Activate `planning` skill.

## Github Actions URL
 $ARGUMENTS

Use the `planner` subagent to read the github actions logs, analyze and find the root causes of the issues, then provide a detailed plan for implementing the fixes.

**Plan File Specification:**
- Every `plan.md` MUST start with YAML frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "{Brief title}"
  description: "{One sentence for card preview}"
  status: pending
  priority: P1
  effort: {estimated fix time}
  branch: {current git branch}
  tags: [ci, bugfix]
  created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
  ---
  ```

**Output:**
Provide at least 2 implementation approaches with clear trade-offs, and explain the pros and cons of each approach, and provide a recommended approach.

**IMPORTANT:** Ask the user for confirmation before implementing.
**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing outputs.

**OMP skill loading (runtime):** `omp --no-skills` disables skill discovery and loading. When that flag is active, do not claim automatic skill activation: read each required migrated `SKILL.md` directly with the read tool from `./.omp/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, falling back to `~/.omp/agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. If the native file is absent, consult `./.omp/evcrate/skill-map.json` or `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skill-map.json`, then read the archived package under `./.omp/evcrate/skills/` (or the published `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skills/` path), then follow the instructions. Without `--no-skills`, use OMP's normal skill discovery.
