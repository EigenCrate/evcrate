Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.

## Mission
**Think hard** to analyze and fix these issues:
<issues>$ARGUMENTS</issues>

## Workflow
1. If the user provides a screenshots or videos, use `ai-multimodal` skill to describe as detailed as possible the issue, make sure developers can predict the root causes easily based on the description.
2. Use `debugger` subagent to find the root cause of the issues and report back to main agent.
3. Activate `debugging` skills and `problem-solving` skills to tackle the issues.
4. Start implementing the fix based the reports and solutions.
5. Use `tester` agent to test the fix and make sure it works, then report back to main agent.
6. If there are issues or failed tests, repeat from step 2.
7. After finishing, respond back to user with a summary of the changes and explain everything briefly, guide user to get started and suggest the next steps.

**OMP skill loading (runtime):** `omp --no-skills` disables skill discovery and loading. When that flag is active, do not claim automatic skill activation: read each required migrated `SKILL.md` directly with the read tool from `./.omp/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`, falling back to `~/.omp/agent/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`. If the native file is absent, consult `./.omp/evcrate/skill-map.json` or `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skill-map.json`, then read the archived package under `./.omp/evcrate/skills/` (or the published `~/.omp/agent/evcrate/skills/` path), then follow the instructions. Without `--no-skills`, use OMP's normal skill discovery.
