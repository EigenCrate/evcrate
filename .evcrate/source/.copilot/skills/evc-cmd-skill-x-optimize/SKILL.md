## Invocation contract

The literal `$ARGUMENTS` is the exact raw text following `/evc-cmd-skill-x-optimize`. Do not split, normalize, or discard it before the canonical command parses it.

Read the mandatory documentation ownership policy at `@evcrate/workflows/documentation-management.md`. The workflow list below is navigation, not a preload instruction. Follow the canonical command's read conditions and activation-first ordering; load full mentoring only after resolved explicit or inherited mode.

## Available workflow assets

- `@evcrate/workflows/advice-activation.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/advisory-interview.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/development-rules.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/documentation-management.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/orchestration-protocol.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/plan-progress.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/primary-workflow.md`

Think harder.
Use `skill-creator` and `evc-claude-code` skills.
Use `evc-docs-seeker` skills to search for documentation if needed.

## Arguments
SKILL: $1 (default: `*`)
PROMPT: $2 (default: empty)

## Your mission
Propose a plan to optimize an existing skill in `.copilot/skills/${SKILL}` directory. 
When you finish, ask user to review your plan:
- If the user approve: Write down a plan follow "Output Requirements", then ask user if they want to start implementing.
- If the user reject: Revise the plan or ask more questions to clarify more about the user's request (ask one question at the time), then repeat the review process.

## Additional instructions
<additional-instructions>$PROMPT</additional-instructions>

## Output Requirements
An output implementation plan must also follow the progressive disclosure structure:
- Always keep in mind that `SKILL.md` and reference files should be token consumption efficient, so that **progressive disclosure** can be leveraged at best.
- `SKILL.md` is always short and concise, straight to the point, treat it as a quick reference guide.
- Create a directory using naming pattern from `## Naming` section.
- Save the overview access point at `plan.md`, keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each phase with status/progress and links.
- For each phase, add `phase-XX-phase-name.md` files containing sections (Context links, Overview with date/priority/statuses, Key Insights, Requirements, Architecture, Related code files, Implementation Steps, Todo list, Success Criteria, Risk Assessment, Security Considerations, Next steps).

**IMPORTANT:**
- Skills are not documentation, they are practical instructions for Claude Code to use the tools, packages, plugins or APIs to achieve the tasks.
- Each skill teaches Claude how to perform a specific development task, not what a tool does.
- Claude Code can activate multiple skills automatically to achieve the user's request.
