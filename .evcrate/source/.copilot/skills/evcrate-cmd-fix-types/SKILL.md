## Invocation contract

The literal `$ARGUMENTS` is the exact raw text following `/evcrate-cmd-fix-types`. Do not split, normalize, or discard it before the canonical command parses it.

Before executing this command, read these EVCrate workflow assets:
- `@evcrate/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/advisory-interview.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/development-rules.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/documentation-management.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/orchestration-protocol.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/primary-workflow.md`

Run `bun run typecheck` or `tsc` or `npx tsc` and fix all type errors.

## Rules
- Fix all of type errors and repeat the process until there are no more type errors.
- Do not use `any` just to pass the type check.
