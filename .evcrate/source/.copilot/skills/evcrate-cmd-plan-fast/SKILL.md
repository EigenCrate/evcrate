## Invocation contract

The literal `$ARGUMENTS` is the exact raw text following `/evcrate-cmd-plan-fast`. Do not split, normalize, or discard it before the canonical command parses it.

Read the mandatory documentation ownership policy at `@evcrate/workflows/documentation-management.md`. The workflow list below is navigation, not a preload instruction. Follow the canonical command's read conditions and activation-first ordering; load full mentoring only after resolved explicit or inherited mode.

## Available workflow assets

- `@evcrate/workflows/advice-activation.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/advisor-mentoring.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/advisory-interview.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/development-rules.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/documentation-management.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/orchestration-protocol.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/plan-progress.md`
- `@evcrate/workflows/primary-workflow.md`

Think.
Activate `evcrate-planning` skill.

## Your mission
<task>
$ARGUMENTS
</task>

## Pre-Creation Check (Active vs Suggested Plan)

Check the `## Plan Context` section in the injected context:
- If "Plan:" shows a path → Active plan exists. Ask user: "Continue with this? [Y/n]"
- If "Suggested:" shows a path → Branch-matched hint only. Ask if they want to activate or create new.
- If "Plan: none" → Create new plan using naming from `## Naming` section.

## Workflow
Use `evcrate-planner` subagent to:
1. If creating new: Create directory using `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section, then run `node .copilot/evcrate/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs {plan-dir}`
   If reusing: Use the active plan path from Plan Context.
   Make sure you pass the directory path to every subagent during the process.
2. Follow strictly to the "Plan Creation & Organization" rules of `evcrate-planning` skill.
3. Analyze the codebase by reading `codebase-summary.md`, `code-standards.md`, `system-architecture.md` and `project-overview-pdr.md` file.
4. Gathers all information and create an implementation plan of this task.
5. Ask user to review the plan.

## Output Requirements

**Plan Directory Structure** (use `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section)
```
{plan-dir}/
├── reports/
│   ├── XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── plan.md
├── phase-XX-phase-name-here.md
└── ...
```

**Plan File Specification**
- Every `plan.md` MUST start with YAML frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "{Brief title}"
  description: "{One sentence for card preview}"
  status: pending
  priority: P2
  effort: {sum of phases, e.g., 4h}
  branch: {current git branch}
  tags: [relevant, tags]
  created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
  ---
  ```
- Save the overview access point at `{plan-dir}/evcrate-cmd-plan.md`. Keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each implementation phase with status and progress plus links to phase files.
- For each phase, create `{plan-dir}/phase-XX-phase-name-here.md` containing the following sections in order: Context links (reference parent plan, dependencies, docs), Overview (date, description, priority, implementation status, review status), Key Insights, Requirements, Architecture, Related code files, Implementation Steps, Todo list, Success Criteria, Risk Assessment, Security Considerations, Next steps.

## Important Notes
- **IMPORTANT:** Ensure token consumption efficiency while maintaining high quality.
- **IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
- **IMPORTANT**: **Do not** start implementing.
