Description: ⚡⚡⚡ Create detailed plan with parallel-executable phases

Codex note: when this recipe says to run another `/...` command, invoke the matching `cmd_*` skill for that path.

For high-impact architecture, security, debugging, or review decisions, consider explicit `$advisor-strategy` use for current-session guidance; this pointer does not activate it.

## Subagent Completion Contract

Delegation is blocking by default. The parent agent must wait for each delegated agent's terminal response before starting dependent work, touching shared files, marking a step complete, or replying with a final result.

- Parallel prompt format: **spawn N agents; wait for all N to finish; collect one terminal result from each; then summarize**.
- Wait protocol: use the native agent wait/poll operation for the same agent set. **"No agents completed yet" is a non-terminal poll result; wait again.** Do not treat it as a timeout, sleep instead of polling, restart, interrupt, or advance the workflow.
- A polling interval or retry count is not a delegation deadline. Do not invent a wall-clock limit (including 180 seconds) for a blocking gate. Continue polling until a terminal result, explicit user stop, or an actual parent-runtime termination.
- Treat an interrupted, timed-out, missing, or partial result as a failed gate. Do not continue from partial work or silently skip/restart the agent.
- Sequential prompt format: **run one agent; wait for its terminal result; verify the report/artifacts; then run the next agent**.
- Every delegated prompt must define scope, file ownership, expected report/artifact, and validation signal.
- A spawn acknowledgement, progress event, or file change does not mean the agent completed. Completion requires the terminal response and requested validation.
- If the parent runtime ends before completion, preserve the agent identity and report the gate as incomplete; never fabricate a result or launch a replacement.

Think strategically about parallelization.
Activate `planning` skill.

## Your mission
<task>
{{args}}
</task>

## Workflow
1. Create a directory using naming pattern from `## Naming` section in injected context.
   Make sure you pass the directory path to every subagent during the process.
2. Follow strictly to the "Plan Creation & Organization" rules of `planning` skill.
3. Use multiple `researcher` agents (max 2 agents) in parallel to research for this task:
   Each agent research for a different aspect of the task and are allowed to perform max 5 tool calls.
4. Analyze the codebase by reading `codebase-summary.md`, `code-standards.md`, `system-architecture.md` and `project-overview-pdr.md` file.
   **ONLY PERFORM THIS FOLLOWING STEP IF `codebase-summary.md` is not available or older than 3 days**: Use the matching `cmd_*` skill to run `/scout <instructions>` to search the codebase for files needed to complete the task.
5. Main agent gathers all research and scout report filepaths, and pass them to `planner` subagent with the prompt to create a parallel-optimized implementation plan.
6. Main agent receives the implementation plan from `planner` subagent, and ask user to review the plan

## Post-Plan Validation (Optional)

After plan creation, offer validation interview to confirm decisions before implementation.

**Check `## Plan Context` → `Validation: mode=X, questions=MIN-MAX`:**

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `prompt` | Ask user: "Validate this plan with a brief interview?" → Yes (Recommended) / No |
| `auto` | Automatically execute `/plan/validate {plan-path}` |
| `off` | Skip validation step entirely |

**If mode is `prompt`:** Use `request_user_input` tool with options above.
**If user chooses validation or mode is `auto`:** Execute `/plan/validate {plan-path}` Codex slash command.

## Special Requirements for Parallel Execution

**CRITICAL:** The planner subagent must create phases that:
1. **Can be executed independently** - Each phase should be self-contained with no runtime dependencies on other phases
2. **Have clear boundaries** - No file overlap between phases (each file should only be modified in ONE phase)
3. **Separate concerns logically** - Group by architectural layer, feature domain, or technology stack
4. **Minimize coupling** - Phases should communicate through well-defined interfaces only
5. **Include dependency matrix** - Clearly document which phases must run sequentially vs in parallel

**Parallelization Strategy:**
- Group frontend/backend/database work into separate phases when possible
- Separate infrastructure setup from application logic
- Isolate different feature domains (e.g., auth vs profile vs payments)
- Split by file type/directory (e.g., components vs services vs models)
- Create independent test phases per module

**Phase Organization Example:**
```
Phase 01: Database Schema (can run independently)
Phase 02: Backend API Layer (can run independently)
Phase 03: Frontend Components (can run independently)
Phase 04: Integration Tests (depends on 01, 02, 03)
```

## Output Requirements

**Plan Directory Structure** (use `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section)
```
{plan-dir}/
├── research/
│   ├── researcher-XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── reports/
│   ├── XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── scout/
│   ├── scout-XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── plan.md
├── phase-XX-phase-name-here.md
└── ...
```

**Research Output Requirements**
- Ensure every research markdown report remains concise (≤150 lines) while covering all requested topics and citations.

**Plan File Specification**
- Every `plan.md` MUST start with YAML frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "{Brief title}"
  description: "{One sentence for card preview}"
  status: pending
  priority: P2
  effort: {sum of phases, e.g., 4h}
  branch: {current git branch}
  tags: [relevant, tags]
  created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
  ---
  ```
- Save the overview access point at `{plan-dir}/plan.md`. Keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each implementation phase with status, progress, parallelization group, and links to phase files.
- For each phase, create `{plan-dir}/phase-XX-phase-name-here.md` containing the following sections in order:
  - Context links (reference parent plan, dependencies, docs)
  - **Parallelization Info** (which phases can run concurrently, which must wait)
  - Overview (date, description, priority, implementation status, review status)
  - Key Insights
  - Requirements
  - Architecture
  - **Related code files** (MUST be exclusive to this phase - no overlap with other phases)
  - **File Ownership** (explicit list of files this phase owns/modifies)
  - Implementation Steps
  - Todo list
  - Success Criteria
  - **Conflict Prevention** (how this phase avoids conflicts with parallel phases)
  - Risk Assessment
  - Security Considerations
  - Next steps

**Main plan.md must include:**
- Dependency graph showing which phases can run in parallel
- Execution strategy (e.g., "Phases 1-3 parallel, then Phase 4")
- File ownership matrix (which phase owns which files)

## Important Notes
**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** Ensure token efficiency while maintaining high quality.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
**IMPORTANT:** Do not start implementing.
**IMPORTANT:** Each phase MUST have exclusive file ownership - no file can be modified by multiple phases.
