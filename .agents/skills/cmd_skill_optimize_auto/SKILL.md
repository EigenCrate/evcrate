Command Path: /skill/optimize/auto

Description: Optimize an existing agent skill [auto]

Codex note: when this recipe says to run another `/...` command, invoke the matching `cmd_*` skill for that path.

For high-impact architecture, security, debugging, or review decisions, consider explicit `$advisor-strategy` use for current-session guidance; this pointer does not activate it.

Think harder.
Use `skill-creator` and `codex-cli` skills.
Use `docs-seeker` skills to search for documentation if needed.

## Arguments
SKILL: $1 (default: `*`)
PROMPT: $2 (default: empty)

## Your mission
Optimize an existing skill in `.agents/skills/${SKILL}` directory. 
Always keep in mind that `SKILL.md` and reference files should be token consumption efficient, so that **progressive disclosure** can be leveraged at best.
`SKILL.md` is always short and concise, straight to the point, treat it as a quick reference guide.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Skills are not documentation, they are practical instructions for Codex CLI to use the tools, packages, plugins or APIs to achieve the tasks.
- Each skill teaches Codex how to perform a specific development task, not what a tool does.
- Codex CLI can activate multiple skills automatically to achieve the user's request.
