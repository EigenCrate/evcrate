Description: Migrated command from .codex

Codex note: when this recipe says to run another `/...` command, invoke the matching `cmd_*` skill for that path.

For high-impact architecture, security, debugging, or review decisions, consider explicit `$advisor-strategy` use for current-session guidance; this pointer does not activate it.

## Subagent Completion Contract

Delegation is blocking by default. The parent agent must wait for each delegated agent's terminal response before starting dependent work, touching shared files, marking a step complete, or replying with a final result.

- Parallel prompt format: **spawn N agents; wait for all N to finish; collect one terminal result from each; then summarize**.
- Wait protocol: use the native agent wait/poll operation for the same agent set. **"No agents completed yet" is a non-terminal poll result; wait again.** Do not treat it as a timeout, sleep instead of polling, restart, interrupt, or advance the workflow.
- A polling interval or retry count is not a delegation deadline. Do not invent a wall-clock limit (including 180 seconds) for a blocking gate. Continue polling until a terminal result, explicit user stop, or an actual parent-runtime termination.
- Treat an interrupted, timed-out, missing, or partial result as a failed gate. Do not continue from partial work or silently skip/restart the agent.
- Sequential prompt format: **run one agent; wait for its terminal result; verify the report/artifacts; then run the next agent**.
- Every delegated prompt must define scope, file ownership, expected report/artifact, and validation signal.
- A spawn acknowledgement, progress event, or file change does not mean the agent completed. Completion requires the terminal response and requested validation.
- If the parent runtime ends before completion, preserve the agent identity and report the gate as incomplete; never fabricate a result or launch a replacement.

Set your coding experience level for tailored explanations and output format.

## Usage

`/coding-level [0-5]`

## Levels

| Level | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 0 | ELI5 | Zero coding experience - analogies, no jargon, step-by-step |
| 1 | Junior | 0-2 years - concepts explained, WHY not just HOW |
| 2 | Mid-Level | 3-5 years - design patterns, system thinking |
| 3 | Senior | 5-8 years - trade-offs, business context, architecture |
| 4 | Tech Lead | 8-10 years - risk assessment, business impact, strategy |
| 5 | God Mode | Expert - default behavior, maximum efficiency (default) |

## How It Works

1. Set `codingLevel` in `.codex/.devkit.json`.
   This file is materialized from canonical `.claude/.devkit.json`; update that source before regenerating to persist changes.
2. Guidelines are **automatically injected** on every session start
3. No manual activation needed - it just works!

## Example

Set level 1 in `.codex/.devkit.json`:
```json
{
  "codingLevel": 1,
  ...
}
```

Next session, Codex will automatically:
- Explain concepts and techniques clearly
- Always explain WHY, not just HOW
- Point out common mistakes
- Add "Key Takeaways" after implementations

## Optional: Manual Output Styles

For finer control, you can also use `/output-style` with these styles:
- `coding-level-0-eli5`
- `coding-level-1-junior`
- `coding-level-2-mid`
- `coding-level-3-senior`
- `coding-level-4-lead`
- `coding-level-5-god`
