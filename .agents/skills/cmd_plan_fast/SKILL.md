# cmd_plan_fast

Command Path: /plan/fast

Description: ⚡⚡ No research. Only analyze and create an implementation plan

Codex note: when this recipe says to run another `/...` command, invoke the matching `cmd_*` skill for that path.

For high-impact architecture, security, debugging, or review decisions, consider explicit `$advisor-strategy` use for current-session guidance; this pointer does not activate it.

## Subagent Completion Contract

Delegation is blocking by default. The parent agent must wait for each delegated agent's terminal response before starting dependent work, touching shared files, marking a step complete, or replying with a final result.

- Parallel prompt format: **spawn N agents; wait for all N to finish; collect one terminal result from each; then summarize**.
- Wait protocol: use the native agent wait/poll operation for the same agent set. **"No agents completed yet" is a non-terminal poll result; wait again.** Do not treat it as a timeout, sleep instead of polling, restart, interrupt, or advance the workflow.
- A polling interval or retry count is not a delegation deadline. Do not invent a wall-clock limit (including 180 seconds) for a blocking gate. Continue polling until a terminal result, explicit user stop, or an actual parent-runtime termination.
- Treat an interrupted, timed-out, missing, or partial result as a failed gate. Do not continue from partial work or silently skip/restart the agent.
- Sequential prompt format: **run one agent; wait for its terminal result; verify the report/artifacts; then run the next agent**.
- Every delegated prompt must define scope, file ownership, expected report/artifact, and validation signal.
- A spawn acknowledgement, progress event, or file change does not mean the agent completed. Completion requires the terminal response and requested validation.
- If the parent runtime ends before completion, preserve the agent identity and report the gate as incomplete; never fabricate a result or launch a replacement.

## Your mission
<task>
{{args}}
</task>

## Pre-Creation Check (Active vs Suggested Plan)

Check the `## Plan Context` section in the injected context:
- If "Plan:" shows a path → Active plan exists. Ask user: "Continue with this? [Y/n]"
- If "Suggested:" shows a path → Branch-matched hint only. Ask if they want to activate or create new.
- If "Plan: none" → Create new plan using naming from `## Naming` section.

## Workflow
Use `planner` subagent to:
1. If creating new: Create directory using `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section, then run `node .codex/scripts/set-active-plan.cjs {plan-dir}`
   If reusing: Use the active plan path from Plan Context.
   Make sure you pass the directory path to every subagent during the process.
2. Follow strictly to the "Plan Creation & Organization" rules of `planning` skill.
3. Analyze the codebase by reading `codebase-summary.md`, `code-standards.md`, `system-architecture.md` and `project-overview-pdr.md` file.
4. Gathers all information and create an implementation plan of this task.
5. Ask user to review the plan.

## Output Requirements

**Plan Directory Structure** (use `Plan dir:` from `## Naming` section)
```
{plan-dir}/
├── reports/
│   ├── XX-report.md
│   └── ...
├── plan.md
├── phase-XX-phase-name-here.md
└── ...
```

**Plan File Specification**
- Every `plan.md` MUST start with YAML frontmatter:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: "{Brief title}"
  description: "{One sentence for card preview}"
  status: pending
  priority: P2
  effort: {sum of phases, e.g., 4h}
  branch: {current git branch}
  tags: [relevant, tags]
  created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
  ---
  ```
- Save the overview access point at `{plan-dir}/plan.md`. Keep it generic, under 80 lines, and list each implementation phase with status and progress plus links to phase files.
- For each phase, create `{plan-dir}/phase-XX-phase-name-here.md` containing the following sections in order: Context links (reference parent plan, dependencies, docs), Overview (date, description, priority, implementation status, review status), Key Insights, Requirements, Architecture, Related code files, Implementation Steps, Todo list, Success Criteria, Risk Assessment, Security Considerations, Next steps.

## Important Notes
- **IMPORTANT:** Ensure token consumption efficiency while maintaining high quality.
- **IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
- **IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
- **IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.
- **IMPORTANT**: **Do not** start implementing.
